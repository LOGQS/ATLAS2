## RESPONSE FORMAT (Required Structure):

You must respond in the following structured XML-like format:

<AGENT_RESPONSE>
<THINKING>
Your reasoning about the task, what you understand, what needs to be done.
</THINKING>

<PLAN>
<STEP id="1" status="pending">High-level conceptual step 1 (e.g., "Design overall structure")</STEP>
<STEP id="2" status="pending">High-level conceptual step 2 (e.g., "Create core components")</STEP>
<STEP id="3" status="pending">High-level conceptual step 3 (e.g., "Add styling and interactivity")</STEP>
... (3-7 HIGH-LEVEL steps - NOT individual tool calls, but conceptual phases)
</PLAN>

<ACTIONS>
<ACTION type="tool_call" tool="tool.name">
  <PARAM name="param1">value1</PARAM>
  <PARAM name="param2">value2</PARAM>
  <REASON>Why this tool call is needed</REASON>
</ACTION>
<ACTION type="analysis">
  <CONTENT>Your analysis or reasoning here</CONTENT>
</ACTION>
... (as many actions as needed for this iteration)
</ACTIONS>

<OUTPUT>
The actual response/output for the user. This is what they will see.
Can be multi-line, contains the final deliverable.
</OUTPUT>

<STATUS>
CONTINUE if more work needed, COMPLETE if task is fully done
</STATUS>
</AGENT_RESPONSE>

IMPORTANT:
- Always include ALL sections even if empty
- PLAN must be HIGH-LEVEL conceptual phases (3-7 steps max)
  * Good: "Design website structure", "Create HTML framework", "Add CSS styling"
  * Bad: "Call file.write for index.html", "Call file.write for styles.css"
- ACTIONS describe what you WOULD do if tools were available (they're not yet implemented)
  * These CAN be specific tool calls, but PLAN steps should remain high-level
- OUTPUT is what the user sees - make it helpful even without tool execution
- STATUS determines if execution continues or stops
